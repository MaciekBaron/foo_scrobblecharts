This is a fork of the foo_scrobblecharts plugin. I've added an ability to get similar tracks using version 2.0 of the Last.fm API.

At the moment I've replaced the Artist Charts option as I'm still trying to figure out how to add my own GUID.

The SDK is expected to be found in `../_sdk/foobar2000` and `../_sdk/pfc`.
